#summary Programmable Device for pets feeding automatically.


= Introduction =

The project goal is to feed pets (cats, dogs, etc...) automatically, controlled by programmable schedule and operating autonomously without any maintenance (except adding food in device) and without any external AC or DC power.
 
The device is powered by solar panel and rechargeable battery that guarantees 5-6 days power without solar energy (in case of very bad weather).

The battery charging and feeding schedule is controlled via Atmega328 (Arduino MiniPro) and custom designed electrical circuit.

= Details =

The project consists of hardware ([PetFeeder#The_Device the device]) and software ([http://code.google.com/p/petfeeder/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk Arduino code]) parts.

== The Device ==
Device itself consists of 
 * [PetFeeder#Food_Container Food Container]
 * [PetFeeder#Food_Feeding_Part Food Feeding Part]
 * Solar Panel
 * VRLA Rechargeable Battery
 * Microcontroller and Electrical Circuit to control whole hardware


=== Food Container ===
is a box made of Plexiglas constructed to prevent pets access to food or any damage of hardware parts inside. Food and hardware parts also separated by the container's inner division

I used comb to prevent the device from sticking due to food pieces.
